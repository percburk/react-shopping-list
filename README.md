# React Shopping List

## Description

_Duration: 2 days_

This app allows you to make a personalized shopping list that you can add items to by filling out the input fields.  Once filled out, that item will be added to the list along with a "buy" button and a "delete" button. If you have bought the item you will see the item as purchased.  Also, there is an "edit" button which when clicked allows you to edit the input fields of that item.  The app also has a "reset" button and "clear" button.  The "reset" button will mark all the items in the list as "unpurchased" and you will then have the option to buy the items or delete the items again.  The "clear" button will delete all list items from the list.

## Installation

1. Create a database named _react-shopping-list_,
2. The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install, npm install axios, npm install sweetalerts2 --save
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!


## Usage

1. Lets say you are a home health aide and you go shopping for your client every Friday.
2. A shopping list will make your life much easier, especially if your shopping list is on your phone
3. Your life is also made easier if your shopping list can remember what you bought and how much you bought last time, or if you had something on your list but were unable to purchase that item.
4. With this app, that home health aide's trip to the store is made much easier.
